# Design Thinking Project

Through this project, I have gained valuable insights into the design thinking process, particularly how empathy and problem definition play a crucial role in creating solutions that truly identify user needs. By conducting surveys and interviews, I learned the importance of listening to students’ opinions regarding health services at PKU such as long queues, unclear waiting times, and clashes with class schedules, which helped us frame actionable problem statements. The ideation and prototyping phases taught me how creativity and practicality must be balanced, as ideas are even more effective when they can be translated into user-friendly interfaces like the Figma prototype we developed. Testing further emphasised the need for continuous improvement, like feedback on font sizes, time selection, and icon clarity highlighted how small details can significantly impact usability. For improvement, I believe the system could integrate more advanced features such as automated notifications, integration with academic timetables, or even an AI-driven chat box to improve time efficiency in replies on enquiries. Personally, this assignment has strengthened my appreciation for teamwork, as each member’s role was essential in shaping the final prototype. It also reinforced the idea that technology solutions must remain student-centred and adaptable. In future, I aim to apply these lessons not only in academic projects but also in real-world IT challenges, ensuring that my work remains innovative, empathetic, and impactful.
